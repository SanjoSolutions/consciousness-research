# Consciousness Research

This work is devoted to God.

## Works

* "Truth vs. Falsehood - How to tell the difference" by David R. Hawkins: This book seems to be the most focused on consciousness research of the books by David R. Hawkins. It states a list of the principles of the science of consciousness which seem to be a good basis for consciousness research.

## Spiritual practices

* Surrendering ones will (at depth) to God seems to calibrate at 850.
* Devotional acts seem to calibrate at 540.

## Recommended pracices for consciousness calibration

* Always ask for permission before you calibrate something.
* Always state explicitly the intention to serve God (i.e. in the form of "In the name of the highest good").
* Always only calibrate things other than calibrating if you have permission, if you have permission. And only find out if you have permission via consciousness calibrations.

From my experience revelation can reveal information that can be helpful for further inquiry with consciousness calibrations. Consciousness calibration calibrates at 600.
Revelation calibrates at or above 500 and below 540. Therefore consciousness calibration calibrates higher than revelation and therefore it seems to make good sense to always
verify via consciousness calibration that what seems to have been revelead calibrates indeed at a high consciousness level. This can potentially bring into awareness spiritual mistakes
from those consciousness levels (the temptations of pride, exploitation, seduction and mistaken as personal).

When one has surrendered ones will at depth to God it seems also possible that consciousness calibration occurs impersonally when conditions are favorable (i.e. something that the intellect cannot work out otherwise practically).

Developing an open-mindesness seems to be benefitial to receive more accurate answers (that it is has been calibrated at or above 555 and below 556).

While doing consciousness calibrations the final doorway can swing open. If that's the case be willing to surrender at depth to God which includes the believe in a personal self.

## Other recommended practices

* Before choosing to follow a teacher or teaching, verify first that it serves the highest good to do so and choose to do so only when it does.

## Note regarding the consciousness level numbers

The numbers seem to represent the exponent of 10 raised by the power of the exponent.

Therefore the difference of potency of power of two consciousness levels A and B (with B > A) can be calculated with 10^B - 10^A.
The result is, how much more powerful B is compared to A.

The difference of for example 990 and 991 in terms of potency of power is much bigger than between 200 and 201.

## Formal logic

The words "and" and "or" are used in logical expressions (expressions where those words connect multiple conditions or expressions where a range is stated) like they are defined in boolean algebra.

### Definition of logical and

| A | B | A and B |
|---|---|--------|
| false | false | false |
| false | true | false |
| true | false | false |
| true | true | true |


### Definition of logical or

| A | B | A or B |
|---|---|--------|
| false | false | false |
| false | true | true |
| true | false | true |
| true | true | true |

## Research

Please verify that it serves the highest good before incorporating any of the information into your life.
Please also verify with a consciousness calibration technique if the information is correct.

### The basis for that muscle testing works

The following research is based on what I have read regarding that "a course of miracles" students which seem to have completed the lesson that the mind only believes what one chooses to believe, tested strong to what many others seem to have tested weak to.

* That consciousness research via muscle strength is based on a believe that the muscle goes weak with negativity (content that calibrates below 200) and stays strong with positivity (content that calibrates at or above 200) calibrates at or above 446 and below 447.
* The believe that the muscle goes weak with negativity (content that calibrates below 200) and stays strong with positivity (content that calibrates at or above 200) calibrates at or above 256 and below 257.

### Consciousness above the levels of human consciousness (above 1000)

* Archangles: 50000+
* Angels: 500+

### Surrendering ones will at depth to God

In the name of the highest good, I have permission to ask if it's enough to surrender ones will at depth to God once, so that the will stays surrendered at depth to God. (true)

In the name of the highest good, it's enough to surrender ones will at depth to God once, so that the will stays surrendered at depth to God. (true)

### Consciousness level of a virus

A virus seems to calibrate at 0.5.

This seems to also show that there is content that calibrates below 1.
But above 0, because death (which has been calibrated at 0) is impossible (Life is eternal).

### Content on the lowest consciousness levels

I have once witnessed the calibration of calibrations that seem to have calibrated on what consciousness levels the lowest entities calibrate. It seems to be around 10^-26 (0.0000000000000000000000001).

### Consciousness level of the book "The Map of Consciousness Explained: A Proven Energy Scale to Actualize Your Ultimate Potential"

The book has been calibrated to calibrate at or above 866 and below 867.

### Other calibrations

| Content | Consciousness level / Consciousness level range |
|---|---|
| World of Warcraft (computer game) | at or above 557 and below 558 (this has been calibrated from a consciousness level close to the consciousness level range that has been calibrated) |
